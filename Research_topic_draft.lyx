Motivation and background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the enormous growing trends of information technology in modern generation,
 the evolution of digital era has become more mature in the sense of effectivene
ss and easiness for societies.
 Trusted entities such as financial institutions may offer their products
 and services to the public through the Internet.
 Consequently, human society has been enthusiastically eager to utilize
 technology means such as emails, websites, online payment system, social
 networks to achieve their tasks efficiently, affordable and more relevant.
 However, the advancement in information and communication technology has
 been a double-edged sword.
 It becomes easier to get personal information about someone in the cyber
 world.
 Cyber criminals see this opportunity as a way to manipulate consumers and
 exploit their confidential information such as usernames, passwords, bank
 account information, credit card or social security numbers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the well known cyber crimes is called phishing.
 Phishing attacks aim to gain a financial benefit by masquerading legitimate
 institutions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Moreover, phishing techniques may associated with fake emails and fake
 websites, however, the essence of this malicious behavior is the art of
 social engineering and deception

 i.e.
 how to trick the potential victims into disclosing their sensitive information.
 To illustrate one specific example; a phisher impersonates a well-known
 bank institutions and sends fake email announcing there is system upgrade
 to its customers, so the phisher would ask the customers to verify their
 usernames, passwords and credit card numbers in order to complete the system
 upgrade.
 In worst case, a clueless bank customer would have no idea and fail to
 ascertain that legitimate bank institutions would never ask for such things.
 Consequently, an unsuspecting victim might took the bait into divulging
 their sensitive information to the perpetrators.
 More concrete mechanism to carry out phishing attacks is that when the
 phishers send a large number of phishing emails which include malicious
 link or URL which redirect recipient to a fake website.
 A phishing email might be resembling a legitimate email so that unsuspecting
 victim might think that it is a genuine.
 By looking like a genuine email, it would help to circumvent the filtering
 system 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ma2009detecting"

\end_inset

.
 One of phishing email methods is providing a malicious URL within its content,
 however, filtering systems of phishing email may have access to blacklist
 database of URLs that are currently being pushed, such as crowd sourced
 Phishtank.
 So the phishers might diverge the URL to bypass the matches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make phishing email efficient, its context might require potential victim
 to urgently act upon it, for example an email informs about suspended account
 in a banking website.
 Phishing attacks are carried out using fake emails, fake websites and often
 phishers may exploit the end user’s web browser to bypass warnings and
 URL information.
 Several countermeasures have been studied to detect phishing emails, such
 as the technique of looking for bit string that are previously determined
 as spams and phishing emails 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "wardman:2009"

\end_inset

.
 The common characteristics of fake email sent by the phishers would be
 misleading hyperlinks and misleading header information 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "zhang:2006,zhang:2007"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, one of the non technical approach to defense against cyber
 fraud such as security awareness education to the public to ignore links
 within an email, even though the source of the email appear to be legitimate
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sheng:2010"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The success of phishing attack through distributed emails is determined
 by the response of the unsuspecting recipients.
 User decisions to click a link or open an attachment in an email might
 be influenced by how strong a phisher can persuade a victim.
 However, current countermeasures in a phishing email so far do not consider
 psychoanalytic approach such as persuasion techniques, which it might be
 important for user decision.
 Thus, characterization and the relevancy of phishing email properties as
 well as the relevancy of persuasion techniques with these structural properties
 could fill the void.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin our research topic by understanding what is phishing itself; how
 phishing emerged in term of history and conduct literature surveys on phishing
 definition.

 Secondly, we will explore its damage in term of money.
 Thirdly, we will conduct an overview of its modus operandi.
 In the fourth section, we will introduce a brief explanation on types of
 phishing.
 In the fifth section, we will address the general phishing countermeasures.
 Lastly, in the last section of this chapter, human factor in phishing attacks

What is phishing?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
While the Internet has brought convenience to many people for exchanging
 information, it also provides opportunities to carry malicious behavior
 such as online fraud on massive scale with a little cost to the attackers.
 The attackers can manipulate the Internet users instead of computer system
 (hardware or software) that significantly increase the barriers of technologica
l crime impact.
 Such human centered attacks could be done by social engineering.
 According to Jakobsson, et al.
 phishing is a form of social engineering that aim

 to retrieve credential from online users by mimicking trustworthy and legitimat
e institutions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Phishing has a similar basic principle as ‘fishing’ in the physical world.
 Instead of fish, online users are lured by authentic looking communication
 and hooked by authentic looking websites.
 Not only that, online users also may be lured by respond to a phishing
 email, either replying or clicking an obfuscated link within its content.
 There are diverse definitions of phishing in our literature reviews, therefore,
 we would like to discuss about its universal definition in later section.
 However, one of phishing definitions according to Oxford dictionary:

 After successfully gaining a sensitive information from the victim, phishers
 use this information to access victim’s financial accounts or committing
 credit card frauds.
 However, to formalize the damage of phishing in term of money is a challenging
 task.
 We will briefly explore the cost of phishing attacks in the later section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
Furthermore, the technique or modus operandi of phishing may vary, but the
 most common technique of phishing attacks done by using fraudulent emails
 and websites
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "james:2005"

\end_inset

.
 A fraudulent website is designed in such a way that it may be identical
 to its legitimate target.
 While it may be true, phishing website also could be completely different
 with its target as there is no level of identicalness.
 With this in mind, preliminary analysis on what changed or added in phishing
 website would be conducted in the later section.
 In the following subsections, we will introduce how phishing was originally
 came about and how current literatures formally define phishing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*

\lang american
The History
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
The first time the term "phishing" was published by the AOL UseNet Newsgroup
 on January 2, 1996 and was started to expand in 2004 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "phishorg"

\end_inset

.
 Since then, we considered phishing development in cyberspace has been flourishi
ng by phishers to make profit.
 Total losses due to phishing in 2004 reached more than U.S.
 $ 2 billion, it was involving more than 15,000 sites that become victims
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fellman:2004"

\end_inset

.
 We will try to discuss about direct and indirect cost at present days in
 the later section.
 Evidently, Jakobsson, et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

 mentioned that in the early years of 90’s (according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "phishorg"

\end_inset

 it was around 1995) many hackers would create bogus AOL user accounts with
 automatically generated fraudulent credit card information.
 Their intention to give this fake credit card information was to simply
 pass the validity tests performed by AOL.
 By the time the tests were passed, AOL was thinking that these accounts
 were legitimate and resulted to activate them.
 Consequently, these hackers could freely access AOL resources until AOL
 tried to actually bill the credit card.
 AOL realized that these accounts were using invalid billing information,
 thus deactivated the account.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
While creating false AOL user accounts with fake credit card information
 was not exactly phishing attacks, but AOL’s effort to counter against the
 attacks was leading to development of phishing.
 This countermeasure includes directly verifying the legitimacy of credit
 card information and the associated billing identity, forced hackers to
 pursue alternative way 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 Hackers were masquerading as AOL’s employees asking to other users for
 credit card information through AOL instant messenger and email system
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "phishorg"

\end_inset

.
 Jakobsson et al.
 suggest that phishing attacks were originating from this incident 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 Since such attack has not been done before, many of users have been victimized
 by then.
 Eventually, AOL enforced warning system to the most of its customers to
 be vigilant when it comes to sensitive information 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "phishorg"

\end_inset

.
 At the present day, phishing attacks might not only being motivated by
 financial gain but also political reason, and they have been emerging not
 only aim to AOL users, but also any online users.
 Consequently, large number of legitimate institutions such as PayPal and
 eBay are being spoofed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*

\lang american
Universal definition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
Before we begin to understand deeper about how and why phishing attack works,
 we will briefly explore common phishing definition.
 Currently, there is no consensus definition, since almost in every research
 papers, academic textbook or journals has its own definition of phishing
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006,james:2005,tally:2004,clayton:2005,parno:2006,jakobsson:2005,dhamija2006phishing"

\end_inset

.
 Phishing is also constantly evolving, so it might be very challenging to
 define its universal terminology.
 There is not so much study that specifically addresses the standard of
 phishing definition.
 However, one research conducted by Lastdrager 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lastdrager:2014"

 addressed to achieve consensual definition of phishing.
 Before we comply with one consensual phishing terminology, we will take
 a look at various phishing definitions from other sources:

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "james:2005,tally:2004,clayton:2005"

\end_inset

 specifies that the phishers only use email as a communication channel to
 trick potential victims.
 While it might be true because using email would be cost effective method,
 but we believe that phishing is not only characterized by one particular
 technological mean, as phishers can also use any other electronic communication
 to trick potential victims (i.e private message on online social network).
 This definition is also similar to dictionary libraries 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "oxford,collins,merriam"

\end_inset

 that mention email as a medium communication between phishers and users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
We believe that standard definition of phishing should be applicable in
 most of phishing concept that are presently defined.
 Consequently, the high level of abstraction and is required to build common
 definition on phishing.
 We have convinced that the formal definition of phishing should not focus
 on the technology that is being used but rather on the technique how the
 deception is being conducted, the method of an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

act
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if you will.
 Therefore, We follow the definition of phishing by Lastdrager

 which stated: 
\end_layout

According to Lastdrager 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

, to achieve this universal definition, a systematic review of literature
 up to August 2013 was conducted along with manual peer review, which resulted
 in 113 distinct definitions to be analyzed.
 We thereby agree with Lastdrager 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lastdrager:2014"

\end_inset

 that this definition addresses all the essential elements of phishing and
 we will adopt it as universally accepted terminology throughout our research.

The cost of phishing attacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
It is a challenging task to find a real cost from phishing attacks in term
 of money or direct cost.
 This due to financial damage for bank is only known by banks and most instituti
ons do not share this information with the public.
 Evidently, Jakobsson et al.
 argue that phishing economy is consistent with black market economy and
 does not advertise its successes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 On this section, a brief explanation of direct and indirect cost on phishing
 attack will be illustrated based on literature review.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
According to Jakobsson et al., direct cost is depicted by the value of money
 or goods that are directly stolen through phishing attack 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 While indirect cost is the costs that do not represent the money nor goods
 that are actually stolen, but it is the costs has to be paid by the people
 who handle these attacks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

 (i.e.
 time, money and resources spent to reset people password).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
As we mentioned earlier, the difficulty of assessing the damage on phishing
 attacks is caused by banks and institutions that keep this information
 themselves and the unwillingness of many users to share to acknowledge
 that they have been victimized by phishing attacks.
 This happens because of fear of humiliation, financial loses, or legal
 liability 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 Evidently, studies estimate the damage ranging from $61 million 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "herley:2009"

\end_inset

 to $3 billion per year 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In addition, the Gartner Group claimed to estimate of $1.2 billion direct

 By the 2007, it escalated to more than $3 billion loss 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The estimation also performed by TRUSTe and Ponemon Institute that stated
 the cost of phishing attack was up to $500 millions losses in the US for
 the same year

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
However, the lack of information such as the detailed of documentation survey
 on how to find these numbers which conducted by Gartner group or Ponemon
 makes these estimations are biased than is generally realized.
 It is interesting to investigate why their estimations are repeated without
 really analyzed when they appeared biased at best.
 One thing come up in our mind that they might have a hidden agenda to make
 societies think that the cost of phishing is high.
 Consequently, people would be obligated to implement anti phishing system
 or engage in phishing awareness in their company which require money.
 With this in mind, we would like to emphasize that our findings on the
 costs of phishing attacks are only estimations without scrutiny from academic
 researchers and it might be an exaggeration.
 Although even if the cost of phishing attack is zero, we believe that phishing
 is still a major problem in terms of trust among users and the misuse of
 email as a means of communication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
Apart from the cost of phishing attacks, we might ask how phishing attack
 is carried out? is there any stages involved? The next chapter we will
 review its modus operandi in term of phishing stages or phases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*

\lang american
Modus operandi
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
As we mentioned earlier, Phishing attack is a subset of identity theft.
 The modus operandi might be carried out firstly by creating a fake website
 that spoofs legitimate website such as financial website, either identical
 or not identical as long as the phishers get responds from unsuspected
 victims.
 After that, the phishers will try to trick the potential victim to submit
 important information such as usernames, passwords, PINs, etc.
 through a fake website that they have created or through email reply from
 victims.
 With the information obtained, they will try to steal money from their
 victims if target institution is a bank.
 Phishers employ variety of techniques to trick potential victims to access
 their fraudulent website.
 One of the typical ways is by sending illicit email in a large scale claiming
 to be from legitimate institution.
 In the email content, they usually imitate an official-looking logo, using
 good business language style and often also forge the email headers to
 make it look like originating from legitimate institution.
 For example, the content of the email is to inform the user that the bank
 is changing its IT infrastructure, and request urgently that the customer
 should update their data with the consequence of loosing their money if
 the action does not take place.
 When the user click the link that was on the email message, they will be
 redirected to a fraudulent website, which will prompt the victim to fill
 in the details of their information.
 While there are various techniques of phishing attack, we will address
 the common phases of phishing that we analyzed by literature survey by
 several studies and also we will address our own phishing phases.
 These phases are compiled in Table

, a phisher usually would do some reconnaissance on how would the attack
 is executed and what information would be obtained from the victim.
 On the second process, the phisher would think about the design of the
 email.
 This email is desired by the phisher to look as legit as possible to potential
 victim.
 For this purpose, target institutions logo, trademark, or symbol are used
 to make the content looks official and legitimate to the victim.
 The author called this process as

.
 From the figure, we can spot a fake email by investigating the real sender
 email address by looking at the email header or the URL provided in the
 body, whether it redirects to the official ING website or not.
 On the third process, the phisher 
\shape italic
fabricates
\shape default
 a story to make potential victim think that email is important.
 To achieve users attention, phisher might build up a story about system
 upgrade, account hijacked or security enhancement so that the victim would
 feel obliged to be informed.
 Evidently, this technique corresponds with Cialdini 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "cialdini:2001"

\end_inset

 that suggests there are six principles to persuade people to comply with
 a request.
 On the fourth process, a phisher usually include 
\shape italic
threatening tone
\shape default
 or explain the urgency and consequences if the potential victim chooses
 not to take action desired by the phisher (for example; account removal,
 account blocked, etc.).
 Consequently, users may fear of their account being deleted.
 The last process involved with fraudulent website that has been created
 by the phisher.
 Users may falsely believe to the message given in the email and may click
 a URL that is embedded in the email.
 Subsequently, the URL would redirect users to a 
\shape italic
spoofed website
\shape default
 which may prompt users’ sensitive information.
 Furthermore, the website might be created to be as similar as possible
 to the target institution’s website, so that potential victim may still
 believe that it is authentic.
 We will explain more on Cialdini’s six basic tendencies of human behavior
 in generating positive response to persuasion

Considering that phishing attack is a process, Wetzel

 by mapping out a common attacks lifecycle, and a possible set of activities
 attackers engage in within each phase.
 The taxonomy is illustrated in Figure

 We speculated that Wetzel's taxonomy is not analogous with Frauenstein's

 suggest that there are several phases involved in phishing attack based
 on the attacker's point of view 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The first phase, it represents the planning, as we understand the attacker
 collects the email address of unsuspecting victims.
 The second phase, considering that it is related to creating a fake email
 that appears legitimate, this phase can be viewed as design phase.
 On the third phase, we consider this as delivery and attack phases as it
 involves the attacker sends the fake email to the unintended victims and
 obfuscated the true source.
 The fourth phase represents attack phase as it involves with the recipient
 complies with the attacker's request(s).
 Lastly the fifth phase, it represents the fraud phase, as it related to
 harvesting and exploiting victim's resources by the attacker.
 Additionally, the phases described by Tally, et al.

Based on our analysis by looking at the pattern of other phases from various

In January 2014, 8300 patients data are being compromised in medical company

.
 The data includes names, addresses, date of birth and phone numbers were
 being stolen.
 Other than demographic information, clinical information associated with
 this data was also stolen, including social security numbers.
 In the April 2014, phishers have successfully stolen US$163,000 from US
 public school based on Michigan 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ashley:2014"

\end_inset

.
 It has been said that the email prompted to transfer money is coming from
 the finance director of the school.
 In March 2014, Symantec has discovered phishing attack aimed at Google
 drive users 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "teri:2014"

\end_inset

.
 The attack was carried firstly with incoming email asking for opening document
 hosted at Google docs.
 Users that have clicked on the link are taken to fraudulent Google login
 page prompted Google users credentials.
 Interestingly, the URL seems very convincing because it hosted on Google
 secure servers.
 We hypothesized that even more phishing incidents on financial area as
 well, but sometimes the news is kept hidden due to creditability reason.
 With this in mind, we believe fake websites might be hosted in the network
 which has more phishing domain than other networks.
 Subsequently, in the next section, we will discuss the general phishing
 countermeasures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

One may ask, what type of phishing are these? What are the general types
 of phishing relevant to our research? Evidently, based on the cost of phishing
 attacks in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-cost-of"

\end_inset

, the threat of phishing attacks is still alarming and might be evolving
 in the future with more sophisticated technique of attacks.
 For this reason, it might be useful to provide a brief insight on popular
 variants of phishing that currently exist.
 We will briefly explain the types of phishing which are the most relevant
 to our research based on Jakobsson, et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 These types of phishing are strongly related to the phishing definition
 that we used, considering phishing is based on the act of deception by
 the phishers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*

\lang american
Phishing based on visual similarities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
Since all phishing is based on deception and social engineering, there is
 a phishing scenario based on visual similarities.
 Typical scenario of phishing based on visual similarities is to send a
 large amount of illicit emails containing call to action asking recipients
 to click embedded links 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jakobsson:2006"

\end_inset

.
 These variations include cousin domain attack.
 For example, legitimate PayPal website addressed as www.paypal.com, this
 cousin domain attacks confuse potential victims to believe that www.paypal-secur
ity.com is a subdivision of the legitimate website due to identical looking
 addresses.
 Similarly, homograph attacks create a confusion using similar characters
 to its addresses.
 For example, www.paypal.com and www.paypa1.com, both addresses look the same
 but on the second link, it uses “1” instead of “l”.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
Moreover, phishers may embed a login page directly to the email content.
 This suggests the elimination of the need of end-users to click on a link
 and phishers do not have to manage an active fraudulent website.
 IP addresses are often used instead of human readable hostname to redirect
 potential victim to phishing website and JavaScript is used to take over
 address bar of a browser to make potential victims believe that they are
 communicating with the legitimate institution.
 We will also see few examples of malicious JavaScript on our preliminary
 analysis section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
Another type of deceptive phishing scheme is rock-phish attacks.
 They held responsible for half a number of reported incidents worldwide
 in 2005 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "moore:2007"

\end_inset

.
 These attacks evade email filters by utilizes random text and GIF images
 which contain the actual message.
 Rock phish attacks also utilize a toolkit that capable to manage several
 fraudulent websites in a single domain.
 Sometimes, deceptive phishing schemes lead to installation of malware when
 users visit fraudulent website and we will describe malware based phishing
 scheme in the next section.

Generally, malware based phishing refers to any type of phishing which involves
 installing malicious piece of software onto users' personal computer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Subsequently, this malware is used to gather confidential information from
 victims instead of spoofing legitimate websites.
 This type of phishing incorporates malwares such as keyloggers/screenloggers,
 web Trojans and hosts file poisoning.

One of the common approaches to detect phishing attacks is the implementation
 of restriction list.
 As the name suggest, it prevents users to visit fraudulent websites.
 One of the efforts to achieve restriction list, is to derive phishing URLs
 from Phishtank.
 Phishtank is a blacklisting company specifically for phishing URLs and
 it is a free community web based where users can report, verify and track
 phishing URLs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Phishtank stores phishing URLs in its database and is widely available
 for use by other companies for creating restriction list.
 Some of the big companies that are using Phishtank’s data includes; Yahoo
 Mail, McAfee, APWG, Web Of Trust, Kaspersky, Opera and Avira.
 In this section, we will discuss how the current literatures have to do
 with phish data provided by Phishtank.
 The first step to achieve the list of relevant literatures regarding phishtank
 is by keyword search in Scopus online library.
 By putting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Phishtank
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as a keyword search, it results in 12 literatures.
 The next step, we read the all the abstracts and conclusions of the resulting
 keyword search and we decided 11 literatures that are relevant to our research.
 Lastly, Table

 For example, in the case of individual wealth in a country, 80% of the
 all wealth is controlled by 20% of population in a country.
 It makes sense that in Phishtank’s verification system, a single highly
 active user’s action can greatly impact the system’s overall accuracy.

 Moreover, there are some ways to disrupt Phishtank verification system;
 submitting invalid reports accusing legitimate website, voting legitimate
 website as phish, and voting illegitimate website as not phish.

 scenario is more direct and the first two actions rather subtle intention

To put it briefly, the lesson of crowd sourced anti-phishing technology
 such as Phishtank is that the distribution of user participation matters.
 It means that if a few high value participants do something wrong, it can
 greatly impact overall system

 Also, there is a high probability that bad users could also extensively

Machine learning approach in detecting spoofed website
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
The fundamental of phishing detection system would be to distinguish between
 phishing websites and the legitimate ones.
 As we previously discussed, the aim of phishing attack is to gather confidentia
l information from potential victims.
 To do this, phishers often prompt for this information through fraudulent
 websites and masquerade as legitimate institutions.
 It does not make sense if phishers created them in a way very distinctive
 with its target.
 It may raise suspicions with result of unsuccessful attack.
 To put it another way, while it might be true, we speculated that most
 of the phishing websites are mostly identical with its legitimate websites
 as target to reduce suspiciousness from potential victim.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
In contrast of one of blacklisting technique we saw in Phishtank that heavily
 depend on human verification, researchers make use of machine learning
 based technique to automatically distinguish between phishing and legitimate
 either websites or email.
 Basically, machine-learning system is a platform that can learn from previous
 data and predict future data with its classification, in this case, phishing
 and legitimate.
 In order for this machine to learn from data, there should be some kind
 of inputs to classify the data, it is called features or characteristics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
Furthermore, there are also several learning algorithms to classify the
 data, such as, logistic regression, random forest, neural networks and
 support vector machine.
 However, as this particular topic is out of scope of our research, we will
 not discuss about the learning algorithm that is currently implemented.
 We will only introduce three features that are used in machine learning
 based detection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
There are vast amount of features to be used in machine learning to detect
 phishing attack.
 Literatures are selected by keyword search such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

phishing + detection + machine learning
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We analyze three features: lexical feature, host-based feature and site
 popularity feature.
 Each of these features will be introduced briefly as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\lang american
Lexical features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
Lexical features (URL based features) are based on the analysis of URL structure
 without any external information.
 Ma, et al.
 suggest that the structure URL of phishing may “look” different to experts
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ma:2009"

\end_inset

.
 These features include how many dots exist, the length, how deep the path
 traversal do the URL has or if there any sensitive words present in a URL.
 For example the URLs https://www.paypal.com and http://www.paypal.com.example.com/
 or http://login.example.com/ www.paypal.com/, we can see that the domain paypal.com
 positioned differently, with the first one being the benign URL.
 Le, et al suggests we can extract the features related to the full URL,
 domain name, directory, file name and argument 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "le:2011"

\end_inset

.
 For example we want to extract features related to the full URL; we can
 define the length of the URL, the number of dots in the URL, and whether
 the blacklisted word presents in the URL.
 The blacklisted words consist of sensitive words such as confirm, account,
 login or webscr.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
Lexical features analysis may have performance advantage and reduces overhead
 in term of processing and latency, since it only tells the machine to learn
 URL structure.
 90% accuracy is achieved when utilizing lexical features combined with
 external features such as WHOIS data

 For example, attackers could simply remove embedded domain and sensitive
 words to make their phishing URLs look legitimate.
 Embedded domain feature examines whether a domain or a hostname is present
 in the path segment

 Furthermore, according to

Each of these features does matter for phishing detection.
 However, as our main objective is synthesizing cialdini's principle with
 phishing emails, we will not describe each of these features in detail.
 It is noteworthy that some of the features are subset of another feature,
 for instance, autonomous system number (ASN), IP country and number of
 registration information are derived from WHOIS information.
 Nevertheless, we will only explain few of them that we assume the most
 crucial.

WHOIS information: Since phishing websites and hacked domains are often
 created at relatively young age, this information could provide the registratio

 Domain ownership would also be included; therefore, a set of malicious
 websites with the same individual could be identified.

 Evidently, they indicated that even after 28 days after training, users
 trained by PhishGuru were less likely to click the link presented in the
 simulated phishing email than those who were not trained.
 They also find that users who trained twice were less likely to give informatio
n to simulated fraudulent website than users who were trained once.
 Moreover, they argue that the training does not decrease the users’ willingness
 to click on the links from legitimate emails; it means that less likely
 a trained user did a false positive when he or she requested to give informatio
n from true legitimate emails

Phishing attacks generally aim to manipulate end users to comply phisher's

 Such manipulation in phishing attacks is achieved by social engineering.
 It means that human element is tightly associated with phishing.

 For example in phishing email context, an email from Royal Bank inform
 us that we have not been logged into our online banking account for a quite

 and if we would like to continue to use the online banking facility, we
 have been asked to click the URL provided.
 Potential victim may perceives their online banking account as their valuable
 matter to access facility and information about their savings.
 Consequently, potential vicim may react to the request because of their
 account could be scarce and restricted.
 In the real world example, a hard worker bank customer who perceives money
 is a scarce item may immediately react when his bank inform him that he
 is in danger of losing his savings due to

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this report, we have tried to summarize all relevant literature.
 We have outlined the basic understanding related to general phishing in
 respect to its history.
 We have also reviewed its universal definition from various sources.
 One study aggregated and systematically achieved the consensual definition
 of phishing in which we follow.
 We have also briefly explain the damage of phishing in term of direct cost.
 We have learned that some organizations which measures the direct cost
 of phishing attacks are being biased and thus we doubted the state of it.
 However, we believe that phishing is still an issue in terms of trust among
 users and the misuse of email as a means of communications.
 We have learned that human factor is one of the most critical aspects in
 phishing.
 Many studies suggest several phases when phishing attack occurred and we
 tried to synthesized these phases and determined our own phases based on
 the attacker point of view.
 We have outlined the general type of phishing includes phishing based visual
 similarities and malware based phishing.
 Many studies suggest both technical and social countermeasures such as
 restriction list, machine learning approach to detect spoofed website and
 anti phishing training.
 However, we have found an absence of empirical research conducted to investigat
e the role of persuasive elements as a human factor in respect to phishing
 email which can be an aspect to be considered to prevent phishing attack.

\begin_layout Standard
We have formulated two research questions and some hypotheses based on our
 impressions from literature.
 We have also outlined a methodology to perform the data analysis that hopefully
 can answer the research questions from its findings.
